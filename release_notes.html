		<h1>Version 1.1 (Mar 3, 2010)</h1>
		<p>It has been almost a year since the first release - wow! This version fixes a crash, some other bugs and contains a few new features. Overall it's a nicer experience though <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>. The development has been on and off, but I definitely have no lack of ideas for Undertext. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/undertext/wiki/Roadmap">Go see the roadmap wiki-page on the website</a> for a list. <em><strong>Please note:</strong></em> The older version will stop working because the OpenSubtitles.org API server is changing it's URL.</p>
		<h2>Changes in this version</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bug:</strong> The app would crash (silently) if a connection error would occur during startup, search or download. Now a dialog will get shown and a reconnect menu item is in the application menu.</li>
			<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Selecting a language in the dropdown before a search wouldn't filter correctly</li>
			<li>Existing entries in the result table will be kept when doing multiple searches</li>
			<li>Added sorting functionality to result table.</li>
			<li>Added a right click menu for the result table with some useful actions.</li>
			<li>Now the small info window will, except for subtitle info, also display info for video files and the OpenSubtitles.org server and website.</li>
			<li>Will appear to start faster because windows get shown earlier</li>
			<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Couldn't close and then reopen windows</li>
			<li>Add a preference window with settings for OpenSubtitles.org accounts</li>
			<li><strong>Bug:</strong> Progress indicator wouldn't always hide after a download</li>
			<li>Switched XMLRPC library to one written in Objective-C</li>
			<li>Update to new API URL.</li>
			<li>Always suffix subtitle file names with language code.</li>
			<li>Undertext will appear in the list when using "Open With" in Finder.</li>
			<li>Ask before overwriting an existing subtitle file.</li>
		</ul>

<div class="release" id="version-1-0">
	<h1>Version 1.0 (Mar 13, 2009)</h1>
	<p>This is the first release of <strong>Undertext</strong>. The application isn't done and I'm planning to do more releases. <em><strong>Please note:</strong></em> It doesn't have any error handling yet so if, for example, no internet connection is present or OpenSubtitles.org's servers have a problem the app will crash and burn :)</p>
	<h2>New features</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Searches for subtitles online when you open Undertext with movie file(s).</li>
  	<li>Looks recursively for movie files when opened with one or several folders.</li>
  	<li>Can filter results by language.</li>
  	<li>When downloading subtitles it names the subtitle after the movie file, so you don't have to change the name yourself.</li>
  	<li>Can optionally add language name to downloaded subtitles.</li>
  	<li>Search results are shown in a table easy to choose subtitles from.</li>
  	<li>Extra info is shown in a separate window for the currently selected subtitle.</li>
  	<li>Sparkle is used for automatic updates.</li>
	</ul>
