# Undertext for Mac OS X

Download subtitles for your movies and your tv episodes from [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org) using Undertext.

Undertext is a desktop application for Mac OS X with the aim to be simple, quick and easy to use. Compared to using the web browser it's a very quick and comfortable way to find good subtitles. The searching is done by calculating a unique [hash value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) for every movie file and then looking in OpenSubtitles.org's database for matching subtitles. This way, any subtitles found *should be* correctly sync'ed with your video file.

**Website:** http://code.google.com/p/undertext. Find the latest downloads, browse the source code, submit bugs, suggest new features and get more info.

This app wouldn't be possible without [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org). Thanks!

## Download and Install

[Download the latest version from the download page](http://code.google.com/p/undertext/downloads/list). The only requirement is that you have Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or newer installed. Just open the downloaded dmg-file and drag and drop the contained app to your Applications-folder.

For those interested, [the source code can be checked out through SVN](http://code.google.com/p/undertext/source/checkout) and any developers or hackers should check Readme.rtf.

## Usage

When you open movie files and folders with Undertext it will launch to search for matching subtitles. Among the found subtitles you select the ones you want to download and then click "Download selected". Voilà! You can perform additional searches by using "Open..." in the application menu.
